## MMOEASA Solution Validator
This program exists purely to validate solutions. The application takes a CSV file containing a solution in a specific format. The program contains the objective function from the original MMOEASA source code. It is here to prove that the solutions the Python application is claiming that it has found are indeed of the spec that the Python app says they are.

The file `solution.csv` generated by the Python application is loaded upon execution of this program. There's an invocable function in `../data.py`, which is called from commented-out code in `../MMOEASA/mmoeasa.py`, that will generate the CSV. Uncomment this code to get a CSV of a solution from the non-dominated set.

Note that once it's uncommented, the algorithm will constantly write the first solution in the non-dominated set to a CSV (once one has been found), so add a breakpoint to this line to stop it being constantly written. The reason this is the case was for simplicity's sake during implementation of this feature: this C application does not need to prove that the best solution is feasible as the Python app claims, it only needs to prove that any solution the Python app claims is feasible is indeed so.
