## Solomon's 25- and 50-customer Problem Instances
These problem instances have been archived as the implementation of the Hypervolumes have rendered them unusable in this application.

The Hypervolumes present (in `/solomon_100/hypervolumes.json`) correspond only to the 100-customer problem instances. As the Hypervolumes are necessary in MMOEASA, MMOEASA is therefore restricted to the 100-customer instances.

As a result, Ombuki's Algorithm is also restricted to the 100-customer instances as it would be an unfair experiment; making comparisons using 25/50 customers in Ombuki's Algorithm and 100 in MMOEASA.
